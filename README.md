### Project 1: Comparative Study of Ensemble Learning Techniques

**Overview:**
This project delves into the realm of ensemble learning, specifically comparing two powerful techniques: Random Forest and XGBoost. The primary goal is to conduct a comprehensive analysis in diverse scenarios, including imbalanced classes, noisy data, varying dimensionality, and large datasets. By training and evaluating both models across these scenarios, the project aims to unveil the strengths, weaknesses, and applicability of Random Forest and XGBoost, offering valuable insights into their performance characteristics.

**Implementation:**
The scenarios are carefully designed, and datasets from reputable sources such as Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, and others are used. The report encompasses a literature review, scenario design and analysis, and a conclusion with recommendations based on the findings. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are employed, and computational efficiency is compared in terms of training time and memory usage for both algorithms.

### Project 2: Image Segmentation with Clustering Algorithms

**Overview:**
This case study focuses on the task of image segmentation using clustering algorithms, specifically K-means, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and DBSCAN. The project explores the effectiveness of these algorithms on diverse RGB images, comparing both qualitatively and quantitatively. The dataset comprises 4 images, and tasks include experimenting with different numbers of clusters, tuning hyperparameters for DBSCAN, and exploring the impact of feature space and data preprocessing on the segmentation results.

**Implementation:**
The report provides a detailed summary of the comparison study, considering different setups, including feature space augmentation and data preprocessing. Results are visualized, and insights are interpreted to offer a clear understanding of the algorithms' performance. The report is structured in a Jupyter notebook format, providing well-commented code snippets alongside explanations for easy comprehension.
